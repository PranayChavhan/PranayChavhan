## 💻 Technologies and Tools

Here are some of the languages and tools I work with:

- **React.js** ⚛️: I have expertise in React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Its component-based approach and virtual DOM make it efficient and flexible for creating dynamic web applications.
- **Node.js** ⚡: I have hands-on experience with Node.js, a powerful JavaScript runtime environment. It allows me to build scalable and efficient server-side applications.
- **Express.js** 🌐: I leverage Express.js, a minimalist web application framework for Node.js, to build robust APIs and handle server-side routing.
- **MongoDB** 🍃 and **MySQL** 🗄️: I work with both MongoDB and MySQL databases to manage and store data for my applications.
- **Laravel** 🚀: I am proficient in Laravel, a powerful PHP framework for building web applications. Its expressive syntax and rich ecosystem enable me to create robust and scalable solutions.
- **Tailwind CSS** 💅: I love using Tailwind CSS for styling my projects. Its utility-first approach and extensive set of pre-built classes make it easy to create visually appealing designs.
- **Firebase** 🔥: I have utilized Firebase for building scalable and real-time applications. Its features such as authentication, cloud storage, and real-time database have proven invaluable in my projects.


## 🌱 Learning Journey

Currently, I'm focused on enhancing my skills in **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)**. I am exploring various AI and ML algorithms and frameworks to broaden my knowledge in this exciting field.

I recently completed a project called "**SignSense**," which involved building a web application for sign language recognition using neural networks and MediaPipe. It was an incredible experience, and I am excited to continue exploring the possibilities of AI and ML in my future projects. 🤖
